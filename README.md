# React + Vite

This is the frontend folder containing layout code of receiving notifications with the help of toast and client side socket.io, I have used React + Vite along with tailwind css in it. It receives the notifications generated from the backend and renders it on the screen by click on request notification button.
For setting up it simply run the commands:
npm install.
npm run dev.(for frontend).
or
npm run dev (when both folders Notify-frontend and Notify-backend are stored in one folder. It will spin both folders.
As I have used package concurrently and made a command as a script in package.json of main folder which is available in Notify-backend.
